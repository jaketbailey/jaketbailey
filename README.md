👋 Hi, I’m Jake Bailey, I have just finished my Placement Year working as a Combat Systems Software Engineer at BAE Systems Naval Ships. In September I will be heading back to University to finish studying for my BSc (Hons) Software Engineering degree at the University of Portsmouth.

- 🧑‍💻 I have the most experience with:
  - JS/HTML/CSS
  - Node.js
  - Python,
  - React.js & Next.js
  - Vue.js
  - MATLAB
- 🙌 I would love to collaborate on any type of project, even if it is unfamiliar, as I will learn more along the way!
